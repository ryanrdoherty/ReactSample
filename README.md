# ReactSample
Sample Flux/React+Jersey Application

This software is intended to illustrate a most basic usage of Facebook's Flux architecture and React view framework.  The client code will interact with a RESTful web service implemented in Java using JAX-RS (Jersey).  Documentation is limited but hopefully the code is pretty self-explanatory.  My hope is for it to be educational; if it serves as a jumping off point for new applications, all the better.
